This is a simple game of Yahtzee I created because I wanted
to see what is was like to play without any extra manipulations
to the randomness of the dice rolls, like most mobile apps do.
Since I really couldn't be sure if any of the digital versions 
of Yatzee were fair in terms of randomness I decided to make 
one myself, so here it is, a simple and fair game of yahtzee.

I have found that this version seems to feel different even from the
tabletop, classic version. The dice rolls use a simple syntax: 
"irandom(5) + 1", and the seed of how GMS2 generates these random numbers
is also changed each time the game is loaded.

I tired to be transparent about how "random" works in this game, since
it is impossible to know what is being manipuled behind the scenes of any
game. While this is usually done to the player's benefit, making random
chance "feel" right, I wanted to know what it felt like unchanged.
